# This is the default kernel table (OMAP3440 turbo mode):
# [opp_id] [frequency(Hz)] [vsel(nominal)]
#  6        800000000       66
#  5        720000000       62
#  4        550000000       56
#  3        500000000       50
#  2        250000000       39
#  1        125000000       32
#
# Please note that the effective vsel (voltage select) value will be determined
# by smartreflex, so there is no need to try to enter as low vaule as you percieve
# as still stable. Smartreflex will find the optimal values for your particular
# device automatically.
# (You can check the effective sr_adjust_vsel by 'cat /proc/overclock/mpu_opps')
# Also note that the 125000000 rate is left unused by default, for a reason.

# An example of the whole table rewrite:
# echo "6 900000000 66" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
# echo "5 800000000 66" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
# echo "4 720000000 62" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
# echo "3 600000000 62" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
# echo "2 500000000 50" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
# echo "1 250000000 39" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
